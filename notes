*REQUIRED*

Update the `cart.js` file to do the following:

[x] Create a global variable named `basket` and set it to an empty array.

[x] Create a function called `addItem`. It should:
  [x] take an input parameter for a string `item`
  [x] add the new item to the global array `basket`.
  [x] return `true` indicating the item was added

[x] Create a function called `listItems`. It should:
  [x] loop over the items in the `basket` array
  [x] console.log each individual item on a new line

[x] Create a function called `empty`. It should:
  [x] reset the `basket` to an empty array

----------

*STRETCH* --> Using functions in other functions!

[x] Add a global `const` named `maxItems` and set it to 5.

[x] Create a function called isFull(). It should:
  [x] return `false` if the basket contains *less* than max number of items
  [x] return `true` otherwise (equal or more than maxItems)

[x] Update the required `addItem` function to:
  [x] Use the `isFull` function to prevent more than `maxItems` from being added to the basket.
  [x] If an item was added to the array, return `true`
  [x] If there was no room and the item could not be added return `false`

__Using Array built-in functions!__

[] Create a function called `removeItem`. It should:
  [x] Take an input parameter for a string `item`
  [x] Use [Array.indexOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf) to find the index of the first matching item in the basket.
  [x] Use [Array.splice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice) to remove the first matching item from the basket.
  [] Return the item removed or `null` if the item was not found
